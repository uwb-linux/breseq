Reference Sequence Formats
=============================

This appendix explains how |breseq| handles different reference sequence formats. Specifically, where the properties of different annotations are read in, how they are internally classified, and how they may be converted.

Illegal Characters
--------------------

For all sequence formats:

#. In nucleotide sequences, all characters are converted to uppercase and all non [ATCG] characters are converted to [N].
#. In gene names and locus tags, the characters [,;/|] are replaced with [_].
#. In gene descriptions, the character [|] is replaced with [;].



Types
---------------------

|breseq| does special handling of repeat sequences for predicting transposon insertions. These must have a type of

Repeats
repeat_region, mobile_element

CDS, tRNA
